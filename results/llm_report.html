<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In evaluating heating options for Branitz, two main types are considered: District Heating (DH) systems and decentralized Heat Pumps (HP). Both approaches have been assessed under different scenarios to provide insights based on several key performance indicators (KPIs), such as levelized cost of heat (LCoH), CO₂ emissions, grid impacts, and technical constraints.</p>
<h3>Scenario Comparisons</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Base Case and Low-Temperature District Heating (DH)</strong></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scenario Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both scenarios utilize a biomass-fueled 4th generation DH system. </li>
<li>The supply temperatures differ slightly, but the cost and emissions are identical because the improved insulation of the low-temperature scenario is not reflected in the KPIs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Metrics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LCoH: €176.88 per MWh</li>
<li>CO₂ Emissions: 87.25 tonnes per annum</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure drop is manageable at 0.7 bar.</li>
<li>Pump energy is 3000 kWh annually.</li>
<li>Specific grid parameters like feeder load percentages and transformer issues were not reported, implying a stable network condition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Heat Pump Rollout vs. Heat Pumps with Grid Reinforcement</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scenario Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both scenarios employ heat pumps with a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.5. </li>
<li>The second scenario includes grid reinforcement to handle peak demands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Metrics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LCoH: €110.37 per MWh, noticeably lower than DH scenarios.</li>
<li>CO₂ Emissions: 99.43 tonnes per annum, slightly higher compared to DH.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum feeder load reaches 82%, indicating a significant grid impact.</li>
<li>Transformer overloads occur in both scenarios due to increased demand during peak times, suggesting risks for electric grid sustainability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Trade-Off Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong></li>
<li>
<p>Heat pumps provide a more cost-effective solution in terms of LCoH (€110.37 vs. €176.88 per MWh for DH). This reduction in cost can offer significant savings to consumers and municipalities over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>District heating produces lower CO₂ emissions (87.25 tonnes vs. 99.43 tonnes per annum for HPs), thus offering an environmentally friendly choice for those prioritizing carbon reduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical Considerations:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>District heating scenarios do not exhibit major grid issues, potentially presenting a more reliable solution on the existing infrastructure.</li>
<li>Heat pumps can challenge grid capacity, necessitating further investments for grid reinforcement to prevent overloads, as shown by the occurrence of transformer issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendation</h3>
<p>Given the lower costs associated with heat pumps, they could be a financially attractive option if the municipality is prepared to tackle grid-related challenges, such as potential overloads. However, if minimizing CO₂ emissions and ensuring immediate compatibility with current infrastructure is a priority, district heating remains a viable option, especially under scenarios that allow for biomass utilization.</p>
<p>Where both environmental goals and cost savings are prioritized, a hybrid approach combining both DH for high-density areas with infrastructure capacity and HP in less concentrated regions may offer a balanced solution. Municipal teams should also consider future grid reinforcement plans and potential integration of renewable electricity sources to enhance the sustainability of heat pump solutions.</p>
